# Advent of Code 2023

I started solving [Aoc 2023](https://adventofcode.com) a little bit late this year. It's one of the best coding challenges I have ever seen. My solutions are far from the best :). My goal is just to solve them in the quickest, easiest way for myself and that doesn't necessarily account for best practices or etc.

After I solve each day, I use Github Copilot to add comments and change variable naming for better readability.

Be well and happy new year!
